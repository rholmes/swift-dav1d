# swift-dav1d
Prebuilt dav1d.xcframework (the dav1d AV1 decoder) for iOS, macOS, Mac Catalyst and tvOS.

## Usage

Works as a dependency for C code like libavif (`#include "dav1d/dav1d.h"`), or import as a Swift module with `import dav1d`.

## Notes
- Built using Meson/Ninja + Xcode toolchains on macOS
- Full bitdepth is enabled for maximum visual quality (8/10/16).  
- ASM optimizations are enabled (`-Denable_asm=true`) for NEON/SSSE3, etc.
- Deadâ€‘strip and symbol stripping enabled to reduce binary size.
